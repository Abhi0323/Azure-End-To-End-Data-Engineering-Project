# Azure-End-To-End-Data-Engineering-Project

## Project Summary

This project illustrates a complete data engineering workflow that connects GitHub repositories to Azure services for efficient data ingestion, transformation, and analysis. The goal was to establish a seamless pipeline that reflects real-world business analytics scenarios and to demonstrate a thorough understanding of Azure's data services and tools.

## Process Workflow

* ## 1. Data Ingestion

* **GitHub Repository Connection:** Set up a connection to a GitHub repository to ingest raw data into the Azure environment, bypassing the need for manual file management and enabling direct data flow into the pipeline.

* ## 2. Data Transformation
  
* **Azure Data Factory:** Employed Azure Data Factory to orchestrate the data flow from GitHub to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, setting the stage for processing.
* **Azure Databricks:** Utilized PySpark within Azure Databricks for robust data transformation, ensuring that the data was primed for analysis and adhered to the required format and schema.

* ## 3. Data Storage
  
* **Data Lake Storage Gen2:** Configured to store both the ingested raw data and the transformed datasets, allowing for scalable and secure data management.

* ## 4. Data Analytics
  
* **Azure Synapse Analytics:** Performed analytics on the transformed data using Azure Synapse Analytics, executing SQL queries to uncover business insights and create reports.

## Conclusion

This project encapsulates a sophisticated data engineering ecosystem within Azure, demonstrating a streamlined process from data sourcing to analytical output. The integration of a GitHub repository for initial data hosting provided a foundation for a robust pipeline, incorporating Azure Data Factory for data orchestration, Azure Databricks for transformation with PySpark, and Azure Synapse Analytics for extracting actionable insights. The successful execution of this pipeline not only showcases the interoperability of Azure services but also underscores my ability to engineer a scalable and comprehensive data solution that translates raw data into strategic business value.
